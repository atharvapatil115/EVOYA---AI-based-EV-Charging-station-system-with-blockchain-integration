## 🧠 Project Vision

The electric mobility revolution is here, but the infrastructure isn't keeping up.

Our system aims to solve the real-world problem of inefficient EV charging through:

- Intelligent scheduling
- Real-time monitoring
- Dynamic load balancing using AI
- Clean, scalable user experience

This project is designed to empower both **EV users** and **charging station operators** with data-driven control and sustainability in mind 🌍⚡
